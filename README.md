# Github-API-Visualizer

Visualizer for data taken from the Github API. This could take some work....

### Important Note and Limitationa

This version is incorporating non-authorised requests, and therefore the number of requests which can be made are limited <br>

Due to the nature of the code, and in the interest of having load times shorter than Titanic, the commits per repo are capped at 250.

The visualizer cuurently displays three graphs for the entered user:

* The number of commits in each repo the user has on their profile
* The breakdown of languages by bytes written for their repos combined
* A breakdown of the 50 most recent events by repo for the user
